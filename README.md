# Datamining
Project on data mining using data from a course survey

# The project
The project is written in Java during my 2nd semester (spring 2015). We used data collected through a course survey
to mine patterns. The mining methods used are kNN, k-Means, and Apriori.

The project also involved a lot of preprocessing various string files, which is evident from some of the classes.
